## Education
- University of Science - VNU — Hanoi  
  B.S. in Computer Science and Information Science (Sep 2017 – Jul 2021)

## Experience

- [VietNamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn) — Hanoi  
  Senior Software Engineer (Oct 2023 – Present)
  <!-- - Maintained and fixed bugs for a high-traffic Content Management System used in journalism at VietNamNet, serving over 800 authors, 400 contributors, and handling an average of 60 million monthly visits, utilizing .NET, SQL Server, Elasticsearch, Redis, and RabbitMQ.
  - Collaborated with the AI team to develop a recommendation system using FastAPI, Underthesea, Memgraph, Redis, and Elasticsearch, optimized for improved user experience and handling up to 2000 tpm with an average response latency of 50 ms (Elastic APM).
  - Designed and implemented a user-behavior tracking system processing an average of 1,000 messages per second. Added demographic analytics enabling data exploration and reporting. By combining Redis for short-term caching, MongoDB for long-term/time-series storage, and Elasticsearch for analytics, cut report-generation time to under 10 seconds.
  - Refactored a newspaper crawling system using Python, Selenium, Docker, RabbitMQ, Underthesea, and Stanza to support more domains with a two-step architecture (crawl raw HTML, then extract content). Scales to 250+ newspaper domains and 15,000+ rows of data daily.
  - Developed an image search feature to support journalists and the recommendation system, using the Milvus vector database for similarity search. -->

  - Developed a reporting feature with a Serverless architecture, reducing load on the main server and lowering maintenance costs.
  - Troubleshot and debugged backend issues, identified root causes, and implemented effective solutions. -->

- [Maxflow R&D](https://maxflowtech.com) — Hanoi  
  Software Engineer (Jun 2021 – Nov 2022)
  <!-- - Contributed to a web application platform for simulation and analytics, enabling users to design workflows for complex jobs similar to the MuleSoft model. Implemented customizable packages for standard job processes and user-specific business logic.
  - Built a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, S3, API Gateway, RDS, SQS, and more for a simulation platform to test electric vehicle performance and calculate battery life cycle, enabling flexible and cost-effective deployment. -->

- [VietRad Technology](http://www.minerva-pacs.vn/) — Hanoi  
  Part-Time Software Engineer (Mar 2019 – Jun 2021)
